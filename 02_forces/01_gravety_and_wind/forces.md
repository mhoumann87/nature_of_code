## Newtons first law of motion

A body at rest stays at rest, and a body in motion will keep moving in a straight line at a constant speed, unless acted upon by a force.

> A force is a vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate

We all ready knows what a vector is, and we have worked with acceleration, so we just need mass.

## Newtons second law

Force = Mass \* Acceleration

Or we could use it as

Acceleration = Force \/ Mass
